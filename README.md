# Bus-Tracker
## Description:
This project was an assignment for the MIT XPRO course. We were given some files and code to work with and were instructed to use a public API to create an animated map showing the bus stops between MIT and Harvard.
## How to Run:  
Click the "Stops between MIT and Harvard" button. It will show all the stops between MIT and Harvard.
## Roadmap of future improvements:: 
I plan on creating a map to show all the bus stops in my homewown.
